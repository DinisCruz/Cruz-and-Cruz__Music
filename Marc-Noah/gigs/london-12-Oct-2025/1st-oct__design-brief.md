# Design Brief: Marc Noah's Music Lab Live at The Roebuck
**Event Date:** October 12, 2025 (11 days from now)  
**Client:** Marc Noah's Music Lab  
**Producer:** Dinis Cruz  

## Project Overview
We need visual design assets for a live concert/recording session that embodies the Music Lab's experimental, open-source ethos. The event features "Marc Noah and the Cruzes" (Marc Noah, Emily, and Dinis Cruz) performing at The Roebuck pub in London. This is a zero-budget, community-driven project that will be live-streamed and recorded for multi-channel content distribution.

## Brand Personality
- **Experimental & Innovative:** Music meets open-source technology
- **Transparent & Authentic:** Raw, genuine, work-in-progress aesthetic
- **Community-Driven:** Collaborative, inclusive, "with the fans, for the fans"
- **Professional yet Approachable:** Quality without corporate polish
- **Creative Lab Aesthetic:** Where music experiments happen
