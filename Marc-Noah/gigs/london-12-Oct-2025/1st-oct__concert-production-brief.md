# Concert Production Briefing -- *Marc Noah's Music Lab Live* at The Roebuck (Oct 12, 2025)

## Background

**Marc Noah's Music Lab** is a bold, open-innovation music project
blending agile, open-source principles with music
creation[[1]](file://file_00000000aab062438316c9ed640f2fb3#:~:text=radically%20transparent%20and%20experimental%20way%2C,rapidly%20publishing%20song%20versions%20and).
Co-founded by musician Marc Noah and technologist Dinis Cruz, the Lab
operates as an experimental, zero-budget initiative: all progress is
shared publicly, all outputs use permissive Creative Commons licensing,
and iterative experimentation is the
norm[[2]](file://file_00000000aab062438316c9ed640f2fb3#:~:text=open,versions%20and%20content%20to%20gather)[[3]](file://file_00000000aab062438316c9ed640f2fb3#:~:text=listener%20feedback%20and%20iterate%29,remixing%2C%20sharing%2C%20and%20community%20participation).
This ethos means working transparently (every rehearsal, draft, and idea
is documented and shared), leveraging volunteer creativity over funding,
and continuously refining content based on feedback rather than chasing
perfection on the first try. In practice, it's a **"music meets
open-source"** approach where fans and collaborators actively
participate -- from remixing tracks to volunteering skills -- making the
audience part of the creative
ecosystem[[4]](file://file_00000000aab062438316c9ed640f2fb3#:~:text=since%20budget%20is%20limited%2C%20fans,but%20as%20contributors%20and%20ambassadors).
The upcoming concert on October 12, 2025 at The Roebuck in London is a
natural extension of this philosophy: a live **Music Lab** experiment
designed to showcase Marc's music in a real venue while capturing the
process for a global audience.

## Objective

The primary goal of this event is to **deliver a professional-quality
live performance** that not only entertains the in-person audience but
also yields high-quality recordings for post-production. In essence, the
show doubles as a recording session -- the team will capture
multi-camera video and multi-track audio of the entire performance with
the aim of producing reusable content (live session videos, song
releases, etc.) for public release after the show. The objective is
twofold: **(1)** Give Marc, Emily, and the team a live platform to
perform at their best, and **(2)** generate a rich set of video/audio
material that can be edited, refined, and shared widely under the Music
Lab's open ethos. Success will be measured not just by the applause in
the room, but by the **usable content** created -- we plan to end the
night with recordings that can be published across our channels in the
following days and weeks, extending the concert's impact far beyond the
venue. Ultimately, this event is a proof-of-concept for the Music Lab
method: can a zero-budget, openly-collaborative show feel
**"professional"** and create valuable media content? We aim to
emphatically answer **yes**, by careful planning and execution.

## Core Team and Roles

A successful production requires clarity in each person's role. Below is
the core team for the event and their responsibilities:

-   **Marc Noah -- Lead Musician & Storyteller:** The centerpiece of the
    performance, Marc provides lead vocals and guitar (and other
    instruments as needed). He is the primary artist on stage,
    responsible for delivering heartfelt musical performances. Marc will
    also engage the audience between songs with personal stories or
    context, embodying the project's spirit. As the artist, Marc has
    final say on artistic choices, though he's committed to stepping
    outside his comfort zone in service of the experiment (using the
    agreed token-based system to allow unconventional ideas to proceed
    even if he's
    unsure[[5]](file://file_00000000aab062438316c9ed640f2fb3#:~:text=%E2%80%9Ctoken%E2%80%9D%20system%20for%20creative%20vetoes,Tokens%20as%20a%20starting%20point)).
    He will also interact with fans during and after the show,
    reinforcing the *"for the fans, with the fans"* spirit.

-   **Emily -- Co-Performer & Collaborator:** Emily joins Marc on stage
    as a fellow performer, adding vocal harmonies and instrumental
    support (e.g. backing vocals, possibly keyboards or percussion, as
    applicable). She enriches the musical texture and stage dynamic,
    performing duets or harmony parts with Marc to broaden the show's
    appeal. Emily also serves as a creative collaborator in the Music
    Lab ethos -- she contributes to arranging songs and transitions, and
    helps energize the performance with her own style. Off-stage, Emily
    assists with coordination among the performers, ensuring cues and
    transitions are smooth.

-   **Dinis Cruz -- Producer & Performing Musician:** Dinis serves dual
    roles in this production. As **Producer**, he's the organizational
    backbone and co-founder of the Music Lab project, responsible for
    the overall event strategy, content pipeline, and ensuring all
    media is properly captured and archived. However, for this concert,
    Dinis will be fully committed as a **performing musician** on stage
    throughout the show, playing cajon and guitar (on at least one
    song). This marks a return to his musical roots -- Dinis was the
    drummer in a band with Marc in the Algarve during the 1990s, and
    the trio (Marc, Emily, and Dinis) have already performed together
    in this configuration in Portugal. His stage presence means he
    cannot handle any logistics during the performance itself, so all
    production duties must be delegated to volunteers or handled before
    and after the show. Pre-show, Dinis coordinates the media strategy
    and volunteer briefings; post-show, he oversees content archival
    and distribution.

-   **Media Coordinator (Critical Volunteer Role) -- Technical Director During Show:** With Dinis performing on stage, we need a dedicated **Media Coordinator** to serve as the technical director during the performance. This person will handle all the coordination duties originally planned for Dinis during the show. Responsibilities include: overseeing the camera operators and ensuring they capture key moments, monitoring the audio recording, managing the livestream, coordinating with visual cues/hand signals during the performance, and handling any technical issues that arise. This person should be technically competent, calm under pressure, and familiar with the Music Lab's content goals. They will work closely with Dinis before the show to understand the vision and technical requirements. During the performance, they have full authority to make technical decisions. Post-show, they will lead the immediate data backup process. **This is our most critical volunteer position to fill.**

-   **Media Team (Volunteers) -- Camera, Audio & Stream Operators:** A
    small volunteer media crew will support the technical execution. We
    plan for **2--3 camera operators** (volunteers) to film the show
    from multiple angles -- e.g. one static wide shot and one or two
    roving cameras for close-ups of Marc, Emily, and audience reactions.
    Each camera volunteer is briefed on shot goals and equipped (likely
    using high-quality smartphones or personal cameras, given the
    zero-budget approach). **Audio Engineer** (volunteer or team
    member): ideally one person monitoring audio recording -- capturing
    a feed from the venue soundboard or using external mics to ensure we
    get a clear multitrack recording of vocals and instruments.
    **Livestream Operator/Monitor:** if we livestream, one volunteer
    will manage the streaming device (e.g. a phone on tripod streaming
    to YouTube) and keep an eye on the feed stability and chat. This
    media team will work closely with Dinis, following a checklist for
    setup (cameras charged, audio levels tested, stream started, etc.).
    They'll also help in **post-show data management**, ensuring all
    footage is uploaded to the project's drive or YouTube archive
    immediately after (per the multi-channel content plan). Volunteers
    are acknowledged as crucial collaborators -- many have stepped up
    purely out of enthusiasm for Marc's
    music[[4]](file://file_00000000aab062438316c9ed640f2fb3#:~:text=since%20budget%20is%20limited%2C%20fans,but%20as%20contributors%20and%20ambassadors).

-   **Support Crew & Logistics:** In addition to media, a few supporters
    will handle general logistics. This includes a **Stage Manager**
    role (informal, could be Dinis double-hatting or a volunteer) to
    coordinate timing -- cueing the start, making sure the setlist and
    transitions run as scheduled, and handling any on-site needs. A
    **Logistics Assistant** may help transport gear, set up merchandise
    or banners, and manage the stage setup (music stands, cables) before
    the show and pack-down after. We also welcome anyone who can assist
    with **audience management** (greeting attendees, informally
    capturing feedback). While each person might cover multiple tasks,
    together this support crew ensures the event runs smoothly
    front-of-house and back-stage.

*(Note: As an open project, roles can be fluid -- team members jump in
where needed. However, the above delineation ensures everyone knows
their primary focus.)*

## Timeline

**Current Status:** Today is Wednesday, October 1st, 2025 -- we are 11 days away from the show.

**Pre-Event Preparation (Now -- Oct 11):**
- **Remote Rehearsal Session (Oct 7-8):** Since Marc will be in Portugal until Friday Oct 10th, we'll conduct one remote rehearsal session via video call on Tuesday Oct 7th or Wednesday Oct 8th with all three core performers (Marc, Emily, and Dinis). This session will focus on finalizing the setlist, discussing arrangements, and coordinating musical transitions. Given that the trio has already performed together in the Algarve (Marc on vocals/guitar, Emily on keyboards/vocals, Dinis on cajon), we have established musical chemistry. The remote session will be recorded and select portions may be published as behind-the-scenes content, showing the collaborative preparation process. During this call, we'll confirm which song(s) will feature Dinis on guitar and plan the stage positioning for when all three are performing together.

- **In-Person Rehearsals (Oct 11-12 morning):** Marc arrives in London on Friday, October 10th. We'll schedule rehearsals for Saturday Oct 11th and Sunday Oct 12th morning. These sessions will focus on running through the full set with all instruments, testing the looper and harmonica setups, and ensuring smooth transitions. The Saturday rehearsal will be comprehensive, while Sunday morning will be a focused run-through of any challenging sections. As experienced musicians who have already played together, we expect these rehearsals to be efficient and productive.

-   **Promotion & Audience Outreach:** Starting immediately and ramping up in
    the final week, the team will promote the show both locally and
    online. This includes social media posts announcing the gig,
    personal invitations to Marc's regular fans, and a teaser about the
    live stream for remote viewers. If time permits, a simple **event
    page or mini-website** will be set up with the concert details and
    stream link -- serving as a hub for both local attendees and remote
    fans to get info. (Volunteers with web design skills are welcome to
    help with this.) The branding for the event (posters, online
    graphics) will align with the Music Lab's style -- making use of the
    project logo and possibly a fresh visual theme to mark this "Music
    Lab Live" experiment.

-   **Technical Setup Planning:** With Dinis performing on stage, the media team coordination
    must be handled by designated volunteers. We need to identify and brief
    a **Media Coordinator** who will take Dinis's originally planned technical
    oversight role. This involves preparing all
    equipment: charging cameras, clearing memory cards, packing audio
    interfaces or recorders, and ensuring we have necessary cables and
    power adapters. We will visit or coordinate with The Roebuck's venue
    staff (if possible, a day or two before) to understand the stage
    layout, power sources, and internet availability (for streaming). A
    **briefing call with all volunteers** will be held by Oct 9 to run
    through responsibilities, contingency plans, and safety (e.g.
    securing tripod positions, not blocking exits, etc.). A test private
    live stream may be done in the days before to iron out technical
    kinks.

**Event Day (Sunday, Oct 12, 2025):**
- **13:00 -- Load-In & Setup:** Core team and volunteers arrive early
afternoon at The Roebuck. Equipment load-in begins (instruments, amps if
any, cameras, etc.). The team sets up the stage: arranging microphones,
placing cameras (marking positions for operators), and testing the audio
connections. Dinis will oversee a quick **sound check** with Marc and
Emily: testing vocal mics, guitar pickup, harmonica mic, and the loop
pedal through the PA system. We aim to have all recording devices
configured by mid-afternoon.
- **15:00 -- Full Dress Rehearsal (On-Site):** If time and venue permit,
a short run-through of a couple of key songs on stage will be done with
all systems recording. This is to ensure lighting and camera angles look
good on video, the audio mix is clean, and everyone is comfortable in
the space. We'll run portions of songs that involve special elements
(e.g., the song where Marc steps out from behind guitar) to make sure
monitors, levels, and cues are sorted. Volunteers practice their filming
movements during this time.
- **18:00 -- Doors Open / Audience Arrivals:** Final adjustments are
made as the pub opens for the evening crowd. The team will have a
**welcome area** near the stage with perhaps a small poster or banner of
*Marc Noah's Music Lab*. Any simple merchandise or flyers (e.g. a QR
code linking to Marc's online channels or the project's site) will be
laid out for attendees. A volunteer or two can greet guests, informally
letting them know about the live recording and encouraging them to be an
energetic part of the experience. The livestream (if used) will start a
"Starting Soon" screen around this time, so remote viewers know the feed
is live.
- **19:00 -- Show Introduction:** A designated **volunteer MC** (to be identified and briefed in advance) takes the mic to welcome
everyone. They will briefly introduce **Marc Noah's Music Lab** concept to
set context -- emphasizing that this is a special experimental show
being recorded for a wider audience. They'll thank The Roebuck and the
volunteers, and encourage both live audience and remote viewers to
engage (cheer, comment, be part of the footage). This intro ensures
everyone understands the collaborative vibe of the event. The MC should be someone comfortable with public speaking who understands the Music Lab ethos.
- **19:10 -- Live Performance Begins:** Marc, Emily, and Dinis take the stage
and the music kicks off. With Dinis now as part of the core performance trio
(on cajon and guitar), the musical dynamics are enriched. The performance block is expected to last
~60--70 minutes, likely structured as two sets or one continuous set
with a short midpoint break (for Marc to rest voice and for any
technical adjustments). During the show, the team adheres to the
*Performance Strategy* (detailed below) -- executing the setlist while
also capturing various planned experiments on stage. Volunteers rotate
subtly if needed to get varied shots (ensuring we film both wide crowd
scenes and intimate close-ups). Since Dinis is performing, the **Media Coordinator** (a designated volunteer) will remain vigilant off-stage,
coordinating any on-the-fly changes via hand signals or comms (for
example, if a camera battery dies, they'll signal a backup to move in). If
live streaming, we will also monitor viewer comments for any critical
issues (e.g. "audio is low") and adjust if possible.
- **~20:20 -- Post-Show Wrap-Up:** The trio ends the set (likely with a
high-energy closing number or an emotional highlight song). After final
bows, Marc (with Emily and Dinis beside him) will thank the audience on mic, reiterating
appreciation for being part of this experiment. We may gather everyone
for a quick group photo or video shout-out to send off the stream. Once
the show concludes, the team will promptly stop recordings and begin
**tear-down**.
- **20:30 -- Breakdown & Data Backup:** Volunteers and crew pack up
gear. Equally important: all recorded media (SD cards, camera files,
audio recorder files) are collected immediately. The **Media Coordinator** will designate
one laptop as the **data ingestion station** on-site to begin copying
files (so we have backups before leaving the venue). One copy of raw
footage will be uploaded that same night to the cloud or a **Raw
Archive** YouTube channel (set to private) as a failsafe
backup[[6]](file://file_00000000f92c620a822cb4a2d761d57e#:~:text=1,Best%20content%20reaches%20Official%20channel)[[7]](file://file_00000000f92c620a822cb4a2d761d57e#:~:text=%E2%86%93%20,pdf%20page%204%20of%205).
By the time we depart the venue, we aim to have all content safely
saved. Any borrowed gear is checked and returned to owners. Dinis will assist with this process once off-stage and equipment is packed.

**Post-Event & Content Production (Oct 13 -- onwards):**
- **Initial Content Review (Oct 13--15):** The day after the show, the
core team will review the raw footage and audio. We'll identify standout
moments (e.g. exceptionally good performances of songs, interesting
crowd interaction, any surprise improvisations) that merit further
editing. Marc and Dinis will debrief what worked and what didn't while
it's fresh, possibly logging which parts of the set might be used
"as-is" and which might need post-production fixes or could be dropped.
- **Multi-Channel Content Pipeline (Oct 2025):** Following our
pre-defined multi-channel YouTube strategy, content will flow through
successive
stages[[6]](file://file_00000000f92c620a822cb4a2d761d57e#:~:text=1,Best%20content%20reaches%20Official%20channel).
First, the **Raw Archive** of the full show (complete, unedited video)
is preserved privately online for
reference[[7]](file://file_00000000f92c620a822cb4a2d761d57e#:~:text=%E2%86%93%20,pdf%20page%204%20of%205).
Next, **Working Drafts**: our editing team (Dinis, or any volunteer
video editors) will sync multi-camera footage and clean up audio.
Promising segments (for example, a powerful rendition of a song or a
unique loop experiment) will be edited and reviewed internally. Then,
**Experiments (Lab) Channel**: We will publicly share a few "lab clips"
-- interesting experimental moments or behind-the-scenes snippets -- on
the *Marc Noah -- The Lab* channel to involve the community in the
post-show process. These might be published within a week of the
concert, with context in descriptions (e.g. "Check out this new
arrangement tried live for the first time -- how do you like it?") and
invitations for feedback. As we refine the footage and audio mix,
**successful versions graduate to a Refined channel** -- likely uploaded
as more polished live session videos of individual
songs[[6]](file://file_00000000f92c620a822cb4a2d761d57e#:~:text=1,Best%20content%20reaches%20Official%20channel).
Finally, the absolute best performances (the highlights that represent
Marc at his peak) will be prepared for the **Official channel release**
as part of Marc's main content. These official videos (with improved
audio mastering, nice titles and thumbnails) will roll out a few weeks
after the show, ensuring the live content continues to engage viewers
beyond the event night. This staged release plan means we don't just
drop one video and move on -- we create a sustained narrative of content
improving in quality through each
channel[[8]](file://file_00000000f92c620a822cb4a2d761d57e#:~:text=Key%20Principles,outlets%20for%20trying%20new%20things)[[9]](file://file_00000000f92c620a822cb4a2d761d57e#:~:text=Connection%20to%20Marc%20Noah%27s%20Music,Remember%3A%20Start%20Simple%2C%20Evolve%20Naturally).
- **Post-Production Timeline:** We anticipate rough edits of videos to
be ready by mid-late October. A target schedule: by Oct 20, release an
"experiments highlight" reel or a couple of raw clips for the community
(Lab channel); by Oct 30, publish 2--3 refined live videos (multi-cam,
mixed audio) of individual songs on the Sessions/Refined channel; and in
November, roll out one or more official live videos on Marc's main
channel (possibly timed with other project releases). Throughout this
process, we maintain documentation -- every edit and iteration is
tracked, and feedback from viewers is noted to guide the next steps,
exemplifying our *iterate publicly*
mantra[[8]](file://file_00000000f92c620a822cb4a2d761d57e#:~:text=Key%20Principles,outlets%20for%20trying%20new%20things).
- **Follow-Up Engagement:** Post-concert, Marc will post a heartfelt
thank-you to attendees and supporters on social media, along with some
photos or short clips. We will also encourage fans (both in-person and
online) to share their experiences or any footage they took, further
boosting community involvement. A virtual "watch party" might be
scheduled for the premiere of the official video, re-engaging those who
were at the show as well as new viewers. By late November, the team will
hold an internal retrospective meeting to discuss lessons learned from
the concert production -- what could be improved, and how this
experiment measured up to our objectives in terms of fan engagement and
content creation.

## Recording and Media Strategy

Capturing the event in high fidelity is a top priority. Our Recording &
Media Strategy covers equipment setup, live streaming, and the
subsequent handling of the footage in line with the multi-channel
release system:

-   **Audio Capture:** We plan to record audio at the best quality
    possible given the venue constraints. The ideal scenario is to take
    a direct feed from The Roebuck's mixing board (each
    microphone/instrument feed) into a multi-track recorder or laptop.
    If that's feasible, we'll get isolated tracks for vocals, guitar,
    harmonica, etc., allowing clean post-mix. In addition, we will
    position an ambient room microphone to capture crowd noise and
    natural reverb -- this track can be mixed in later for atmosphere.
    If a direct board feed isn't available, we'll use our own
    microphones: a vocal mic for Marc (likely the same one for PA,
    possibly splitter to recorder), a mic for Emily if singing or any
    instruments she plays, plus a line-in from Marc's guitar (or mic on
    the guitar amp/acoustic sound hole) and a mic on the harmonica if
    used. All these would run into a small digital recorder (operated by
    the audio volunteer). We'll test levels during soundcheck and set
    conservative gains to avoid clipping. Redundancy is planned: for
    safety, at least one camera (or phone) will record audio with a
    decent on-board mic as backup audio in case the main recording
    fails. The outcome should be a set of files that can later be mixed
    into a near-professional live sound.

-   **Video Capture:** As noted, multiple cameras will be used. **Camera
    1**: a fixed wide-angle shot of the stage (capturing both Marc and
    Emily plus a bit of the crowd). This camera (on tripod) ensures we
    always have a safe full-frame recording of every song. **Camera 2**:
    a roaming handheld operated by a volunteer, focusing on close-ups --
    Marc's expressions, guitar playing, Emily's harmonies, hands on the
    fretboard, etc. **Camera 3** (optional): if we have an extra
    person/device, another angle such as a side-stage or even an
    audience-perspective shot can be taken, to have footage of crowd
    reactions and a dynamic feel. All cameras will record in at least
    1080p. We have briefed camera volunteers on maintaining steady shots
    and not over-zooming; smooth, varied footage is the goal. We'll also
    ensure **adequate lighting** on stage -- The Roebuck is a pub venue,
    so lighting can be low; if needed, we'll bring a couple of portable
    LED light panels to illuminate performers without blinding the
    audience, creating a warm intimate scene for video. Immediately
    after the show, all video files will be consolidated. The team will
    follow our multi-channel content workflow: **uploading the raw full
    footage to the private "Archive" channel on YouTube the same day**
    for
    safekeeping[[10]](file://file_00000000f92c620a822cb4a2d761d57e#:~:text=Raw%20Archive%3A%20Upload%20immediately%20after,in%20description%20Explain%20what%27s%20different)[[7]](file://file_00000000f92c620a822cb4a2d761d57e#:~:text=%E2%86%93%20,pdf%20page%204%20of%205).
    Then we will work on slicing and dicing the footage for public
    release (as detailed in the timeline above).

-   **Livestream Plan:** We aim to livestream the performance in
    real-time to engage the remote audience. The current plan is to use
    a smartphone or tablet with a good camera as the streaming device,
    positioned for a clear view of the stage (likely near the front but
    slightly off-center to avoid obstructing the live audience). We will
    stream via YouTube Live (on Marc Noah's channel or a dedicated event
    stream link) so that remote fans can tune in easily. The stream will
    use the built-in phone camera and mic, or if possible, an external
    mic capturing from the mixer for better sound. We understand
    streaming can be risky (network issues, etc.), so we'll do a test
    and have a backup: if the Wi-Fi/cell signal is weak, we might switch
    to recording-only mode and upload immediately after. A volunteer
    (Livestream Monitor) will watch the stream on another device, ready
    to alert the team if something goes wrong (e.g., stream drops or
    sound issues). If all goes well, remote viewers around the world
    will see the show live, and we'll save a copy of the stream on
    YouTube. The stream's existence doesn't change our multi-cam
    recording plan -- it's complementary. In fact, we might repurpose
    the live stream footage (which will have a raw, single-camera
    authenticity) as part of the *Archive* or *Experiments* content
    later.

-   **On-Site Media Coordination:** During the event, the designated **Media Coordinator** (a volunteer briefed in advance) will
    coordinate cues with the media crew discreetly. For example,
    ensuring Camera 2 catches the moment Marc picks up the harmonica, or
    signaling the audio tech to start the backup recorder. We'll
    communicate with simple hand signals or pre-agreed visual cues to
    avoid disrupting the show. The crew has been instructed to be as
    unobtrusive as possible: wear black, move slowly, and respect the
    audience's sightlines. Immediately post-show, the Media
    Coordinator will ensure **all recordings are stopped properly
    and files labeled**. That person will
    then begin the file transfer process (to external drives and cloud).
    We'll use a checklist to not forget anything (e.g., "copy Camera 1
    SD card, verify files okay; collect Camera 2 phone footage, etc.").
    By night's end, we'll have a well-documented trove of media ready
    for editing.

This thorough media strategy ensures we maximize the content output from
the night. Every song, every experiment on stage will be documented.
**"Document Everything"** is a key principle we follow -- every
performance goes into our
archive[[8]](file://file_00000000f92c620a822cb4a2d761d57e#:~:text=Key%20Principles,outlets%20for%20trying%20new%20things)
so that no magic moment is lost. From that foundation, we can then
curate the best material for the world to see.

## Performance Strategy

The show itself is not a standard gig -- it's a **Music Lab live
experiment**, meaning the performance is designed for creativity,
storytelling, and iterative learning. The strategy for the setlist and
on-stage presentation is as follows:

-   **Diverse & Dynamic Setlist:** Marc and Emily have crafted a setlist
    that balances familiarity with experimentation. Expect a mix of
    Marc's original songs and a few beloved covers (possibly including
    those Marc is known for, to hook the casual listeners). However,
    unlike a typical set where each song is done in a routine way, here
    each piece is an opportunity to try something unique. For instance,
    one of Marc's well-practiced cover songs might be delivered in a
    **new arrangement** (different tempo or style) to see how it
    resonates. An original song may be performed twice in the night --
    first in a stripped-down acoustic form and later in a fuller sound
    with looping -- as an experiment in arrangement. We deliberately
    include at least one **"wild card"** segment where Marc might
    improvise or incorporate audience input (e.g., a short freestyle
    lyrical segment or inviting the crowd to sing a chorus) to capture a
    truly spontaneous moment on tape. The setlist order is also designed
    with flow in mind: high-energy numbers open and close the show, with
    a thoughtful narrative arc bridging quieter, intimate songs in the
    middle.

-   **Pushing Marc's Comfort Zone:** A key objective is to encourage
    Marc to step beyond his usual performance habits, as a growth
    exercise and to create compelling content. One planned move is
    having Marc perform **without his guitar** for a song -- likely
    handing off guitar duties to Emily or using a backing track -- so
    that he can focus purely on vocals and stage presence. This is
    outside Marc's typical comfort zone, as he's used to "hiding" behind
    the guitar, but it will make for an interesting dynamic and video
    footage of him engaging the crowd more directly. The team's
    *token-based creative veto system* underpins this risk-taking: Marc
    has a limited number of "veto tokens" he can spend if he feels truly
    uncomfortable, but otherwise he's agreed to trust the process and
    attempt these
    experiments[[5]](file://file_00000000aab062438316c9ed640f2fb3#:~:text=%E2%80%9Ctoken%E2%80%9D%20system%20for%20creative%20vetoes,Tokens%20as%20a%20starting%20point).
    By having this pre-agreed mechanism, we ensure that bold ideas (like
    trying a completely different musical style on a song, or Marc
    swapping instruments) get a fair chance on stage without endless
    second-guessing. So far, Marc is on board and hasn't spent any token
    in rehearsals -- meaning all our planned experiments are a go for
    the live show. We anticipate these moments will be highlights,
    showcasing Marc's versatility and willingness to grow.

-   **Use of Looping and Harmonicas:** Technologically, we are bringing
    in a **loop pedal** to enrich certain songs. Marc has been
    practicing using a looper to lay down a rhythm guitar line live,
    then solo over it or add vocal harmonies. We plan to feature this in
    at least one song (for example, building a layered one-man
    arrangement of an original piece). This not only challenges Marc in
    a new skill but also creates a visually interesting performance for
    the audience (and unique content for video). Additionally, Marc will
    incorporate his **harmonica** on a couple of numbers -- something he
    does occasionally, but here we want to emphasize it by giving him
    space to really shine on harmonica solos. We have prepared a special
    harmonica microphone setup so its sound is captured clearly for the
    recordings. These musical tools (looper, harmonica, perhaps
    unconventional percussion) add variety to the set and align with the
    lab's experimental ethos: it's not just a voice and guitar show,
    it's a multifaceted musical experience. Emily, for her part, might
    use a small percussion instrument (like a shaker or cajón) on some
    songs to fill out the sound when Marc is looping or without guitar.
    All these elements are rehearsed but kept somewhat flexible so that
    if, say, the loop doesn't work perfectly, Marc can gracefully abort
    and carry on the song in a traditional way -- we have backup plans
    for each experiment to ensure the audience still gets a great
    performance even if an experiment "fails".

-   **Transitions & Storytelling:** Rather than awkward silences or
    generic banter, we have planned purposeful transitions between
    songs. Since Dinis is performing, we'll either have the **volunteer MC** join briefly at a couple of transition
    points or Marc himself will handle the storytelling between songs -- sharing short backstories (e.g., the
    inspiration behind an original song, or an anecdote about how many
    times he's played a particular cover at pubs). These
    mini-storytelling moments serve two purposes: they allow Marc to
    connect more deeply with the audience (making the performance
    memorable and personal), and they give our camera crew opportunities
    to reset or reposition without missing musical content. We're
    essentially weaving a narrative through the concert: the story of
    Marc Noah's Music Lab itself will be highlighted. For instance,
    before an experimental arrangement, Marc might explain "Normally I
    always play this song on guitar, but tonight we're trying something
    different as part of our Music Lab experiment" -- educating the
    audience about the project's nature and bringing them in on the
    experiment. Such commentary will be kept concise and engaging. If
    possible, we'll involve the audience directly -- e.g., asking a
    show-of-hands question or getting a cheer to be recorded for the
    video ("everyone scream hello to our online viewers!" etc.). The
    final transition (into the last song) will be a big setup where Marc
    thanks everyone and pours all his energy into the closer, making it
    clear this is the climax.

-   **Contingencies and Adaptability:** Live experiments carry risks, so
    the performance strategy includes contingency plans. If a planned
    bit isn't working (say, the loop pedal misfires or Marc feels too
    nervous without guitar), the performers can smoothly revert to a
    simpler approach. The setlist is built with "pivot points" --
    moments where, depending on the vibe, Marc, Emily, and Dinis might extend a
    song or cut one out. The Media Coordinator will signal if time is running or if an
    encore is possible. The ethos is *flexibility*: we've prepared a
    script, but the team is ready to adapt on the fly, true to agile
    principles. Every unexpected turn can become part of the show (for
    example, if a mistake happens, Marc may joke about it openly --
    which actually provides authentic, endearing footage). Overall, the
    performance strategy is to **embrace the experimental nature** in a
    way that engages the audience. By informing the audience of the
    experiment, we turn them into active participants who root for
    Marc's bold attempts. Whether everything goes perfectly or not, the
    audience will feel they witnessed a unique, one-off musical
    experiment -- which is exactly the goal.

## Audience Engagement and Remote Viewership Goals

Engaging our audience -- both in the pub and online -- is crucial for
making this event more than just a one-off show. We want attendees and
viewers to feel they are part of an ongoing story and to deepen their
connection with Marc's music. Our approach breaks down into before,
during, and after the event:

-   **Pre-Show Engagement:** Prior to the concert, we have been seeding
    interest among the community. On social media, we've shared
    behind-the-scenes snippets of rehearsals and perhaps a personal
    video invite from Marc ("Hey, I'm performing in London, come join
    our experiment!"). We've also highlighted that the event will be
    live-streamed, inviting remote fans to **"RSVP"** by subscribing to
    the channel or setting a reminder for the stream. One goal is to
    create a buzz such that people feel this is not just a gig, but a
    mini-event in the project's timeline. We encourage fans to submit
    questions or song requests online beforehand, some of which Marc
    might acknowledge during the show (making remote fans feel heard).
    For local London followers, we've posted the event details in
    community forums and event pages, emphasizing it's a free, fun,
    creative event. If a website or event page is up, it will include a
    countdown and possibly a teaser video. By show day, we hope to have
    a modest but enthusiastic crowd in person, and a remote audience
    ready to tune in from various locations (including Marc's supporters
    from Portugal and elsewhere).

-   **Engagement During the Show (Live & Stream):** During the
    performance, audience engagement is about **interaction and
    inclusion**. In-person, Marc and Emily will interact with the crowd
    frequently -- from simple things like making eye contact and
    smiling, to explicit interactions like sing-alongs or short Q&A. For
    example, Marc might ask the crowd a question related to a song's
    theme or get them clapping a rhythm that becomes a live loop track.
    These moments not only energize the room, they translate well to
    video, showcasing that the audience is part of the experience. We've
    also prepared a few fun asides specifically as *"content moments"*:
    one idea is to have the audience collectively shout a phrase
    (perhaps a slogan or the project name) on the count of three, which
    we capture on video to use in a future intro or promotional clip.

For remote viewers on the livestream, we plan to make them feel included
too. The **volunteer monitoring chat** will be logged into the
stream and can relay any comments to the performers between songs if
appropriate (for instance, if someone watching from abroad says
"Greetings from Brazil!", we can shout that out). We might even take a
quick pause between songs to address the online audience: e.g., *"I see
people tuning in from across the world -- thank you for joining us in
London tonight!"*. The goal is to reduce the barrier between physical
and virtual attendees. We will encourage those watching at home to hit
the like button, share the stream, or drop comments, effectively turning
engagement into a part of the show's energy.

Additionally, we have a **merchandise/branding element** planned for
engagement: even though this is a zero-budget operation, we've managed
to design a simple *Marc Noah's Music Lab* logo and have a few prototype
merchandise items (like a T-shirt or stickers with the logo or a catchy
lyric). At the show, we might do a *giveaway* -- e.g., *"Who's been
following Marc Noah's Music Lab online? Here's a free T-shirt for you!"*
-- to excite the crowd and create a memorable moment (which also gets
captured on video). For remote fans, we could offer a digital giveaway
(like a free download link or exclusive early access to a new song for
those watching the stream). These little perks reward engagement and
make fans feel valued. All branding (posters, shirts, stream graphics)
will consistently carry the Music Lab theme so that anyone encountering
the content recognizes it as part of Marc's innovative project.

-   **Post-Event Engagement:** After the concert, our focus shifts to
    sustaining the interest we've generated. Immediately after the show,
    we'll publish a heartfelt thank-you message on all platforms --
    including a group photo from the event or a short clip of the
    cheering crowd -- thanking attendees and volunteers and inviting
    everyone to follow along as we process the footage. This tells
    people, *"the story continues -- stay tuned for videos!"* In the
    days that follow, as we start releasing content (raw clips,
    behind-the-scenes vignettes, etc.), we will actively seek audience
    input: *"Which song from the show do you want to see first?"*, *"Any
    cool moments you think we should include in the highlight reel?"*.
    Running small polls or questions will keep the audience invested in
    the outcome. When the edited videos go live, we'll host a **"virtual
    premiere"** on YouTube for the main live video -- scheduling it and
    having Marc and the team in the live chat during the premiere to
    interact with fans as they watch the polished product for the first
    time. We also intend to collect feedback in a more structured way:
    perhaps sending a short Google form to volunteers and attendees
    asking what they enjoyed or what could be improved, feeding those
    lessons into our next iteration.

On the remote viewership side, one of our goals is to analyze the reach
of this concert content. We will track metrics like how many people
watched the live stream live, vs. replay views later, engagement on the
videos, etc., and share those numbers transparently with the community
(*"e.g., one week after the show, the live videos have garnered X views
from Y countries"*). This not only keeps fans in the loop (again
reinforcing openness) but also celebrates the community's role in
growing the
project[[11]](file://file_00000000aab062438316c9ed640f2fb3#:~:text=weeks%20since%20we%20launched%20Song,we%20again)[[12]](file://file_00000000aab062438316c9ed640f2fb3#:~:text=lot%20of%20YouTube%20views%20coming,time%20posted).
If the response is strong, we might plan another similar event sooner;
if it's modest, we'll discuss that openly too. The bottom line is every
viewer or participant should feel their presence mattered. By engaging
the audience before, during, and after in these ways, we aim to
transform a single night at The Roebuck into a lasting chapter of Marc
Noah's journey -- one that fans feel proud to have taken part in.

## Call for Volunteers

Finally, as with every aspect of Marc Noah's Music Lab, **collaboration
and community support** are at the heart of this concert. We are putting
out an open call for additional volunteers and contributors who want to
be involved in this event's success. **No contribution is too small**,
and you'll be part of a creative experiment that values everyone's
input.

Areas where we **need volunteer help** include:

-   **MC/Host (Critical Role):** With Dinis performing on stage throughout the show, we urgently need a confident **volunteer MC** to open the show, welcome the audience, introduce the Music Lab concept, and potentially help with transitions between songs. This person should be comfortable with public speaking, understand the project's ethos, and be able to engage both the live and streaming audiences. They'll work with the team beforehand to understand key talking points. This is an essential role that needs to be filled ASAP.

-   **Media Coordinator (Critical Role):** As mentioned above, we need someone to serve as technical director during the show, handling all the coordination that Dinis would normally do. This person needs to be organized, technically competent, and able to make quick decisions. They'll receive a full briefing from Dinis before the show.

-   **Camera Operators:** If you have a steady hand and either a decent
    smartphone or camera, join our video team. We have a plan for
    multi-angle filming and could use extra operators to ensure no great
    moment goes uncaptured. Experience is welcome but not necessary --
    we can guide you on the shots we need. You'll get credited in the
    video releases for your camera work.

-   **Audio/Sound Assistance:** We're looking for someone with an ear
    for sound to help manage the audio recording. This could involve
    monitoring a recording device or laptop during the show and keeping
    an eye on audio levels. If you have any audio engineering background
    or just enthusiasm to learn, your help would be invaluable to
    guarantee high-quality sound.

-   **Livestream Moderator/Tech:** For the live online audience, it's
    important everything runs smoothly. A volunteer to act as the
    livestream moderator would monitor the YouTube chat for any issues
    and maybe interact with viewers (gather questions or shoutouts for
    Marc). Also, if you're tech-savvy, you can assist with ensuring the
    stream connection is solid (e.g., handling any sudden hiccups like
    restarting the stream if needed). Basically, be the liaison between
    the online fans and the on-site team.

-   **Stagehands & Logistics:** We can always use an extra pair of hands
    for miscellaneous tasks. This could be helping set up equipment
    before the show, adjusting lighting, moving a mic stand during the
    performance, or distributing any handouts to the audience. After the
    show, help in packing up gear carefully is also appreciated. If
    you're the kind of person who likes making sure everything runs like
    clockwork behind the scenes, we'd love your help here.

-   **Media Management & Post-Production:** If you're interested in the
    *after* part of the concert, volunteers are welcome to assist in
    organizing and editing the captured media. For example, someone
    could help upload raw files to our drives, or if you have video
    editing skills, you might help create a highlight reel or sync
    multi-cam footage. This is a bit more technical and can be done in
    the days after the show (remotely is fine). It's a great opportunity
    if you want experience in media production -- and again, you'll be
    credited in the content.

-   **Creative Contributors (Design/Branding/Web):** We're also open to
    creative volunteers who want to enhance the event's presentation. If
    you have graphic design talent, perhaps you can help refine the
    event poster or create simple title cards for the videos. If you're
    into web design, you could assist in setting up a temporary web page
    or improving Marc's website to feature the concert highlights. We
    even welcome ideas like social media content creation (maybe someone
    to live-tweet the event or capture some candid backstage photos for
    Instagram). The project has always thrived on fan contributions --
    e.g., community members have offered to design posters or merch in
    the
    past[[4]](file://file_00000000aab062438316c9ed640f2fb3#:~:text=since%20budget%20is%20limited%2C%20fans,but%20as%20contributors%20and%20ambassadors)
    -- and this event is no different. Your creativity can help spread
    the word and make the project look even more professional despite
    our zero budget.

**Volunteer Coordination:** Dinis will act as the point of contact for
all volunteers. We will have a brief orientation (either via a group
chat or quick meetup) to ensure everyone knows the plan and their role.
We operate with a very collaborative, low-pressure style -- the guiding
mindset is that we're all fans and creators working together ("with the
fans, for the fans" approach). Any volunteer contribution is hugely
appreciated, and we make sure to recognize everyone's efforts publicly.
If you volunteer, you'll be part of the Marc Noah's Music Lab team for
the night: expect a lot of high-fives, a shout-out of thanks at the
show, and being listed in the video credits and project blog. It's a
chance to gain experience in live event production and be part of an
open-source music initiative that might just be pioneering a new way of
doing things.

**How to Volunteer:** If you're receiving this briefing (as part of the
project team), you likely already are involved -- but if you know
someone else who might want to join, please invite them! Interested
volunteers can contact Dinis directly via phone or the project's Discord
channel. Let us know your area of interest and any relevant experience
(if applicable). We'll accommodate as many helping hands as we
reasonably can, and even if roles overlap, there's always something
useful to do. Remember, one of our core principles is making the most of
**community and collaboration** over
budget[[13]](file://file_00000000aab062438316c9ed640f2fb3#:~:text=financial%20investment,must)[[14]](file://file_00000000aab062438316c9ed640f2fb3#:~:text=songs%20might%20volunteer%20to%20shoot,mouth)
-- this event is a prime example. We're excited to work with all of you
to make Oct 12 not just a great concert, but a celebration of what a
passionate group of musicians and volunteers can create together.

*This document is prepared to align everyone on the team with the plan
for the Oct 12th show. It embodies the Music Lab's open, experimental
ethos in a live setting.* *Thank you to every team member and volunteer*
*for contributing your time, talent, and creativity. Let's put on an
amazing show and capture magic in the process. Here's to a successful
concert and the many videos, stories, and new fans that will come from
it!*
