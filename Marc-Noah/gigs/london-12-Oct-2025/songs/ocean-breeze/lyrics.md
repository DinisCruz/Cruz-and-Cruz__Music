# Lyrics - Ocean Breeze

## Marc Noah Original

### Verse
we always talk
about ours dreams
what we will do together
were lighther than a feather

And as we walk
yes it all seems
like this is all forever
we want to live for ever & ever

we rest our minds
as we lay down
i hear the sounds of heaven
whenever your around

so lets just take
it day by day
we dont need much to break it
just step the ground and make it our

### Chorus
own,
you will never walk alone
while we are wondering beside the trees

i,
i will always sing this song
while we are floating in Ocean breeze,
in ocean breeze
