# Claude Code Brief: GitHub Repository Organization for Marc Noah Concert

## Project Context
Organize the GitHub repository at `https://github.com/DinisCruz/Cruz-and-Cruz__Music` to manage all materials for the "Marc Noah and the Cruzes" concert at The Roebuck on October 12, 2025.

Current location of concert files: `/Marc-Noah/gigs/london-12-Oct-2025/`

## Objective
Create a comprehensive folder structure and tracking system to manage all concert materials, enable collaboration, track progress, and prepare content for eventual static website generation.

## Required Folder Structure

### 1. Songs Organization (`/Marc-Noah/gigs/london-12-Oct-2025/songs/`)

Create individual folders for each of the 11 songs in the setlist:
```
songs/
â”œâ”€â”€ 01-road-trip-v1/
â”œâ”€â”€ 02-fast-car-v1/
â”œâ”€â”€ 03-cover-1-TBD/
â”œâ”€â”€ 04-cover-medley-1/
â”œâ”€â”€ 05-more-than-words/
â”œâ”€â”€ 06-marc-original-1-TBD/
â”œâ”€â”€ 07-fast-car-v2/
â”œâ”€â”€ 08-cover-2-TBD/
â”œâ”€â”€ 09-road-trip-v2/
â”œâ”€â”€ 10-cover-medley-2/
â””â”€â”€ 11-happy-birthday/
```

### 2. Per-Song Materials Structure

Each song folder should contain:
```
[song-name]/
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md           # Overview and checklist for this song
â”œâ”€â”€ lyrics.md          # Song lyrics
â”œâ”€â”€ chords.md          # Chord progressions and tabs
â”œâ”€â”€ arrangement.md     # Who plays what, specific arrangement notes
â”œâ”€â”€ score/             # Folder for PDFs, music notation files
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ README.md      # Links to external scores if needed
â”œâ”€â”€ recordings/        # Audio/video references
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ README.md      # Links to YouTube, Google Drive, Spotify
â”œâ”€â”€ transitions.md     # How to enter/exit this song in the set
â”œâ”€â”€ notes.md          # Rationale: Why this song? Meaning, story, performance notes
â””â”€â”€ combined-info.md   # OPTIONAL: For simpler songs, combine multiple elements
```

Note: For simpler songs or covers, multiple elements can be combined into fewer files (e.g., `combined-info.md` could contain lyrics, chords, and notes together).

### 3. Master Tracking File

Create `/Marc-Noah/gigs/london-12-Oct-2025/SONG_STATUS.md` with:

```markdown
# Song Status Tracker

| # | Song | Finalized | Lyrics | Chords | Score | Arrangement | Recording | Notes |
|---|------|-----------|--------|--------|-------|-------------|-----------|-------|
| 1 | Road Trip V1 | ðŸŸ¡ | âœ… | âœ… | ðŸ”´ | ðŸŸ¡ | âœ… | Ready |
| 2 | Fast Car V1 | ðŸŸ¡ | âœ… | âœ… | ðŸŸ¡ | ðŸ”´ | âœ… | Need arrangement |
| 3 | Cover #1 | ðŸ”´ | - | - | - | - | - | **NEEDS SELECTION** |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

Legend: âœ… Complete | ðŸŸ¡ In Progress | ðŸ”´ Not Started | - Not Applicable
```

## Implementation Steps for Claude Code

1. **Create the folder structure** as outlined above
2. **Generate README files** for each directory with appropriate templates
3. **Create tracking files** (SONG_STATUS.md, TASKS.md, TIMELINE.md, etc.)
4. **Set up placeholder files** for each song's materials
5. **Add `.gitkeep` files** to empty directories to maintain structure
6. **Create index/navigation system** through README files
7. **Set up templates** for recurring document types
8. **Initialize TIMELINE.md** with critical dates (Oct 7-8 remote rehearsal, Oct 10 Marc arrives, Oct 11 rehearsal, Oct 12 show)

## Critical Timeline Context

**URGENT: Only 11 days until the concert (as of Oct 1, 2025)**

Key Deadlines:
- **ASAP:** Song selections for TBD slots (Cover #1, Cover #2, Medleys)
- **Oct 5:** All arrangements finalized
- **Oct 7-8:** Remote rehearsal with full team
- **Oct 9:** Volunteer briefing call
- **Oct 10:** Marc arrives in London
- **Oct 11:** In-person rehearsal
- **Oct 12:** Show day

## Additional Notes

- All files should be in Markdown for easy version control and future static site generation
- Use relative links between documents for portability
- Include metadata in frontmatter for future Hugo/MkDocs processing
- Keep large media files in Google Drive/YouTube and link to them
- Use checklists liberally for tracking progress
- Maintain consistent naming conventions (kebab-case for files/folders)
